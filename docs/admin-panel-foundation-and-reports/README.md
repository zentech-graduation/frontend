# Admin Panel Foundation and Report Review

This phase built the frontend foundation for the administrative and moderation panel and the first vertical slice on top of it: the report review workflow.

## What this phase delivered

A moderator can sign in, see the reports awaiting review, open one, see the reported content, and close it.
An administrator can do the same and reach the escalated queue a moderator cannot.

The foundation underneath the workflow:

- Role captured into the session from the login and refresh responses only, and role-based landing after sign-in.
- Two route trees under `/admin`, one per role, lazily loaded, gated inside the existing authentication guard.
- A shared layer every later phase depends on: a declared-key request contract, cursor pagination that terminates on `hasNextPage` and keys on role, error classification, the vocabulary cache, and id-to-username resolution.
- The panel shell with role navigation, the signed-in identity, sign out, and the escalated-count badge.
- The derived patterns: a record table, a filter bar, a status indicator, a reason-carrying confirmation dialogue, a load-more affordance, and the four list states.

The report workflow screens: the report queue, the escalated queue, and the report detail with its actions.

## What a reviewer should open first

1. `report-contract-verification.md`: the sixteen-item contract check against the running backend, committed before any feature code, and the two divergences it found.
2. `design-decisions.md`: every decision the phase was asked to state, the derived patterns and their tokens, the error classification, and the copy convention.
3. `src/features/admin/`: the code, starting at `adminRoutes.jsx` for the tree, `components/AdminShell.jsx` for the shell, and `screens/ReportDetailScreen.jsx` for the workflow.
4. `verification-evidence.md`: what was exercised in a browser and observed.

## How to run it

The backend must be running at `http://localhost:8080` with the compose stack healthy, and the seed accounts must exist (`bash scripts/seed-dev-data.sh` in the backend, every seeded account uses `SeedPass123!`).

From `frontend/`:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server serves the application at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies `/api/v1` to the backend.

Sign in as `admin@seed.local` to land on the administrator panel, or `mod@seed.local` for the moderator panel.
The report queue starts empty on a fresh seed, because reports are created by ordinary users; create a few by having a seed user report another user's content through the application or the API, then review them in the panel.
