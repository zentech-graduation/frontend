# Admin Panel Reconnaissance

What this phase established, and what the next phase can rely on.
Read the other seven files for the evidence.

## State of the system

The backend runs.
It is `develop@c297b03`, Spring Boot on JDK 23, Flyway at schema version 74, serving on `http://localhost:8080` with health UP.
The five-service compose stack (postgres, rabbitmq, redis, mailpit, elasticsearch) is healthy.
The Gorse recommendation module is a separate, un-started compose stack and does not block the panel; it added only the administrator-only `GET /api/v1/admin/user-events` to the surface the panel touches and touched the frontend not at all.
Seeding is idempotent; a `--reset` recovered a clean baseline; all five seed accounts authenticate.
A moderator session and an administrator session were both obtained.

## What the next phase can rely on

- The handoff (`docs/admin-panel/ADMIN_PANEL_HANDOFF.md`) is accurate.
The 47-endpoint role matrix matches in 46 of 47 rows; the one difference (row 42 returns 201, not 200) is documented in the handoff's own section 9.8.
All five headline traps and all six response-shape divergences hold exactly.
Cursor scope, vocabularies, and the statistics and activity-log behaviour all match.
- Two contract caveats matter for building, both in `api-contract-verification.md`.
First, the strict-query-parameter rule holds only for `/api/v1/admin/**`; the report-queue endpoints (`/reports`, `/reports/pending`) accept undeclared parameters with 200.
Second, the handoff's rate-limit numbers are the production profile; the dev profile that runs locally allows `stats/timeseries` and `user-events` at 60 per minute, the broad admin rule at 150, and login at 10 per 60 seconds; only the two search endpoints match at 60 per minute.
- The frontend transport layer is usable largely unchanged: two axios clients, a request interceptor that attaches the bearer, a response interceptor that normalizes and redacts errors, and a single-flight 401 refresh that replays once and hard-redirects on failure.
- Routing is URL-per-screen (the stale docs say otherwise): every screen has a real nested route under `/app`, driven by a `handle: { screen, chrome, rightRail }` metadata pattern the panel can copy.
- Cursor pagination is already implemented correctly (terminates on `pageInfo.hasNextPage`) via `useDrainEmptyPages`; reuse it.
- The design system is internal `Lx*` primitives and `--lx-*` tokens, not shadcn/Radix and not `lucide-react`.
`LxBtn`, `LxTag`, `LxModal`, `LxBottomSheet`, `LxAvatar`, `LxDropdownMenu`, `LxToggle`, `ConfirmModal` (500 ms arming), and `toast`/`ToastHost` cover most panel needs.

## What the next phase must build net-new

Role-based route gating (the guard is not role-aware and the store holds no dedicated role, only `user.role`), a reason-carrying confirmation (extend `ConfirmModal`), a date-range control clamped to 30 days (no picker exists), a record-table and filter-bar composition, a status-indicator vocabulary (needs `--lx-warning` added to the `v` object), and statistics charts (no chart primitive, and no new dependency is allowed).
Detail in `derived-pattern-gaps.md` and `blockers-and-contradictions.md`.

## What could not be verified, and why

- The set of variables the application refuses to start without was not re-derived by deletion.
The running `.env` already satisfies them, and emptying required secrets on a working local environment was judged not worth the disruption; the enforced set is stated from the handoff and `application.yaml` instead.
Attempted-and-decided-against, not blocked.
- A true cold-start Flyway "Successfully applied N migrations" line was not observed, because the database was already migrated; the count (74) comes from `flyway_schema_history` and the "up to date, version 74" start-up line.
- The statistics screens could only be seen empty.
`stats/current` returns nulls and `timeseries` returns no points because no 30-minute bucket has been collected yet; the emptiness condition and the 30-minute interval are established (the latter read from source), but populated statistics were not observed.
Not attemptable within the phase without running the app for 30-plus minutes.
- The full set of written `user_events` types was established from source (7 possible: `session_start`, `search`, `profile_view`, `post_like`, `post_save`, `post_view`, `post_comment`) and labelled read from source; only `session_start` was actually present in the database, so the other six write paths were not observed firing.
- The frontend was inventoried by reading the code, not by running it in a browser.
The transport and routing behaviour is stated from source with the interactive checks noted where done; no browser session was driven.
- Elasticsearch cold-start timing was not re-measured, because the stack was already healthy on arrival.

## Deliverables in this directory

`environment-bringup.md`, `api-contract-verification.md`, `frontend-inventory.md`, `design-inventory.md`, `derived-pattern-gaps.md`, `blockers-and-contradictions.md`, `deferred-findings.md`, and this `README.md`.
The two prerequisite inputs are committed unchanged at `docs/admin-panel/`.
Nothing in either repository was modified outside `docs/`.
