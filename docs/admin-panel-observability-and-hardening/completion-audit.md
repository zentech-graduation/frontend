# Completion Audit

The panel is finished at the end of this phase. This establishes that it actually is.

Everything below was seen working in the browser **during this phase**, not carried forward from a
previous phase's word.

## 1. The fifteen screens

Section 14 of the backend handoff describes fifteen screens (14.1 – 14.15) plus the application
shell (14.0).

**Fifteen screens, ten routes.** Five of the fifteen are surfaces of one account, not destinations
of their own: post moderation, comment moderation, warning issuance, and violations history all
belong to the account they act on, so they are composed onto the account route rather than given
separate addresses a reviewer would have to navigate between while looking at one person. Warning
issuance and violations history additionally appear on the report detail, so a reviewer deciding a
report can see the owner's record and act on it without leaving the report. Each is listed
separately below with where it lives.

| # | Screen (handoff §14) | Route | Reachable by | Seen working this phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 14.1 | Login | `/login` | anyone | Yes — signed in as administrator, as moderator, and as an ordinary account; a moderator lands on `/admin/reports` |
| 14.2 | Report queue | `/admin/reports` | moderator, administrator | Yes — both roles. Empty state seen for a moderator with no pending reports; populated state seen after a report was created |
| 14.3 | Escalated queue | `/admin/escalated` | administrator only | Yes — administrator sees it; moderator gets the not-available page and never calls the count endpoint |
| 14.4 | Report detail | `/admin/reports/:reportId` | moderator, administrator | Yes — post target, user target, and message target; both roles; conflict path exercised |
| 14.5 | Post moderation | `/admin/users/:userId` → posts tab | moderator, administrator | Yes — removed and restored a post twice, including the dropped-hashtag path |
| 14.6 | Comment moderation | `/admin/users/:userId` → comments tab | moderator, administrator | Yes — tab renders with its empty state on an account with no comments |
| 14.7 | Warning issuance | warn dialog on `/admin/users/:userId` and on the report detail | moderator, administrator | Yes — six warnings issued through the dialog, including the third that suspends |
| 14.8 | Violations history | discipline card on `/admin/users/:userId` and on the report detail | moderator, administrator | Yes — warnings-only for a moderator, warnings and strikes for an administrator, revoke exercised |
| 14.9 | My action log | `/admin/actions` | moderator | Yes — moderator sees a table of its own actions |
| 14.10 | Full action log | `/admin/actions` | administrator | Yes — administrator sees every actor, including system-issued strikes |
| 14.11 | Account list and search | `/admin/users` | administrator only | Yes — paginated all 170 accounts, filtered, searched |
| 14.12 | Account detail | `/admin/users/:userId` | moderator (discipline and content), administrator (everything) | Yes — both roles; lifecycle actions, sessions, and reports-against exercised as administrator |
| 14.13 | Hashtag registry | `/admin/hashtags` | administrator only | Yes — listed, created, hit the duplicate-name error, changed a status |
| 14.14 | Statistics | `/admin/statistics` | administrator only | Yes — pre-collection, with data, empty window, gap, zero series, granularity block, rate-limit refusal |
| 14.15 | Activity log | `/admin/activity` | administrator only | Yes — unbounded state, results, empty result, window clamp, event-type filter |
| 14.0 | Application shell | wraps every `/admin` route | both, branching on role | Yes — role-correct navigation on first paint after reload, escalated badge, sign out |

One route exists that is not a screen: `/admin` redirects to the report queue, and any unknown
`/admin/*` path renders a not-found inside the shell.

---

## 2. The moderator tree, walked end to end

Signed in as `mod@seed.local` in its own browser context, with the administrator context signed in
simultaneously (both identities read in the same tick: `@seed_admin` and `@seed_mod`).

**Navigation offered:** `reports`, `actions`. One group, `moderation`. Nothing else.

| Route | Result | Screenshot |
|---|---|---|
| `/admin/reports` | Renders. Empty when no pending report exists, populated when one does | [tree-mod-reports.png](screens/tree-mod-reports.png), [tree-mod-reports-with-pending.png](screens/tree-mod-reports-with-pending.png) |
| `/admin/reports/:id` | Renders. Escalate available on a pending report; resolve and dismiss absent once escalated | [tree-mod-report-detail.png](screens/tree-mod-report-detail.png), [tree-mod-escalated-report-no-close-controls.png](screens/tree-mod-escalated-report-no-close-controls.png) |
| `/admin/actions` | Renders the moderator's own actions | [tree-mod-actions.png](screens/tree-mod-actions.png) |
| `/admin/users/:userId` | Renders discipline and content only. No state-and-actions card, no session list | [tree-mod-account-detail.png](screens/tree-mod-account-detail.png), [tree-mod-violations-warnings-only.png](screens/tree-mod-violations-warnings-only.png) |
| `/admin/users` | Not available | [tree-mod-accounts-BLOCKED.png](screens/tree-mod-accounts-BLOCKED.png) |
| `/admin/hashtags` | Not available | [tree-mod-hashtags-BLOCKED.png](screens/tree-mod-hashtags-BLOCKED.png) |
| `/admin/escalated` | Not available | [tree-mod-escalated-BLOCKED.png](screens/tree-mod-escalated-BLOCKED.png) |
| `/admin/statistics` | Not available | [tree-mod-statistics-BLOCKED.png](screens/tree-mod-statistics-BLOCKED.png) |
| `/admin/activity` | Not available | [tree-mod-activity-BLOCKED.png](screens/tree-mod-activity-BLOCKED.png) |

The five refused routes render the not-available page. **None of them mounts a table**, and none
issues a request that is then refused.

**Instrumented across the whole walk:** 43 API calls, **0 requests to the escalated-count endpoint**,
**0 requests to any administrator-only endpoint**, **0 responses with status 403**, **0 console
errors**.

---

## 3. The administrator tree, walked end to end

Signed in as `admin@seed.local`.

**Navigation offered:** `reports`, `actions` under `moderation`; `escalated` (with its live count
badge), `accounts`, `hashtags`, `statistics`, `activity` under `administration`. Seven links.

| Route | Result | Screenshot |
|---|---|---|
| `/admin/reports` | Renders | [tree-admin-reports.png](screens/tree-admin-reports.png) |
| `/admin/escalated` | Renders | [tree-admin-escalated.png](screens/tree-admin-escalated.png) |
| `/admin/reports/:id` | Renders, post target and user target | [tree-admin-report-detail-post-escalated.png](screens/tree-admin-report-detail-post-escalated.png), [tree-admin-report-detail-user-target.png](screens/tree-admin-report-detail-user-target.png) |
| `/admin/actions` | Renders, all actors including system | [tree-admin-actions.png](screens/tree-admin-actions.png), [tree-admin-action-log-drawer.png](screens/tree-admin-action-log-drawer.png) |
| `/admin/users` | Renders | [tree-admin-accounts.png](screens/tree-admin-accounts.png) |
| `/admin/users/:userId` | Renders with lifecycle, sessions, reports-against, discipline, content | [tree-admin-account-detail.png](screens/tree-admin-account-detail.png), [sessions-list.png](screens/sessions-list.png) |
| `/admin/hashtags` | Renders | [tree-admin-hashtags.png](screens/tree-admin-hashtags.png) |
| `/admin/statistics` | Renders | [tree-admin-statistics.png](screens/tree-admin-statistics.png) |
| `/admin/activity` | Renders | [tree-admin-activity.png](screens/tree-admin-activity.png) |

**Instrumented over an eleven-route sweep:** **0 console errors**, **0 responses with status ≥ 400**,
no screen crashed, and no numbered pagination control exists on any of them.

---

## 4. No control returns 403

Both role trees were instrumented for 403 responses across every route and every control that
renders. **Zero 403 responses were recorded in either tree.**

This holds structurally rather than by luck:

- Administrator-only routes sit behind a guard, so their screens never mount for a moderator and
  never fire a request.
- The escalated-count poll is gated on the role, so a moderator never starts it.
- Account lifecycle controls render from the server's own capabilities object, so a control the
  server would refuse is never drawn.
- The two reads that would 403 for a moderator — the account detail, needed for a target's role and
  status — are now explicitly disabled for a moderator rather than fired and discarded.

## 5. No screen exists that its role cannot use

Every route in the panel is reachable and useful to at least one role, and every route a role can
reach is fully usable by it. The moderator's account detail is the only partial surface: it shows
discipline and content and withholds the administrator-only lifecycle card. It withholds it
entirely rather than rendering an empty card, so the moderator sees a complete screen, not a
truncated one.

---

## 6. The user-facing application is unbroken

Signed in as an ordinary account (`carol@seed.local`) in its own context and walked the whole path.

| Step | Result | Screenshot |
|---|---|---|
| Sign in | Lands on `/app` | — |
| Feed | Renders with posts | [userapp-feed.png](screens/userapp-feed.png) |
| Open a post | Renders with its comments | [userapp-post.png](screens/userapp-post.png) |
| Comment | **Posted and appeared** — the new comment's text was found in the page after submission | [userapp-post.png](screens/userapp-post.png) |
| Profile | Renders, showing the signed-in account | [userapp-profile.png](screens/userapp-profile.png) |
| Settings | Renders in full — account, appearance, and privacy sections. **Still produces two not-found responses on the settings read**, which is the pre-existing defect diagnosed in work item 3.4 | [userapp-settings.png](screens/userapp-settings.png) |

The settings defect was reproduced end to end and diagnosed to the backend and its seed script; the
frontend requests the correct path. Per the phase constraint it was recorded and nothing was
changed. It is item 6 of `docs/admin-panel/backend-request.md`.

**No user-facing application code was modified by this phase.** The only file changed outside
`src/features/admin/` is `src/config/constants.js`, which gained two route constants for the two new
panel routes.

---

## 7. Nothing unresolved sits outside the two documents

Every open item from all four phases now lives in exactly one of two places:

- **`docs/admin-panel/backend-request.md`** — everything that needs the backend. Ten grouped items,
  gathered from all four phases plus this one.
- **`docs/admin-panel-observability-and-hardening/deferred-findings.md`** — everything else still
  open, each tagged with its owner.

The two `explained` items from the hardening sweep (a second administrator cannot be created
reversibly; the hashtag registry has no post-create navigation) are recorded in the sweep itself with
their reasoning, and the first is carried into `deferred-findings.md` as the one check that a future
environment with two administrators should re-run.

Fixture state this phase leaves behind is listed in `deferred-findings.md` so the next person is not
surprised by it.
