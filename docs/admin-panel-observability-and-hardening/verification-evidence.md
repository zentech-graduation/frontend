# Verification Evidence

Every check this phase ran, what was driven, and what was observed. Two browser contexts were used
throughout — an administrator and a moderator, signed in simultaneously — and both the console and
the network were captured.

Nothing here is inferred. Where a number appears it was counted.

## 1. Contract verification

Ran before any feature code was written and committed on its own at `f79763c`. Full detail in
`observability-contract-verification.md`; the checks themselves:

| Check | Driven | Observed |
|---|---|---|
| Statistics paths and their role gate | Called both as `seed_admin` and as `seed_mod` | Administrator 200, moderator **403** on both |
| `stats/current` field inventory | One call as administrator | 12 fields recorded; `computedAt` **not null** in this environment |
| Collection cadence | Read from source | 30-minute interval, 30-minute initial delay, partial start bucket discarded → worst case just under **60 minutes** to a first bucket |
| `timeseries` with no parameters | One call, no query string at all | Server resolved `metric=registrations`, `granularity=half_hour`, a 24-hour window, 18 points |
| Accepted metrics | Read from source, each called | **14**, all 200 |
| Accepted granularities | Read from source, both called, one invalid called | **2** (`half_hour`, `day`); `hour` → 400 |
| Window limit | Bisected | **365 days accepted, 366 refused** — "The window may span at most one year" |
| Fine-granularity horizon | Bisected to the minute | `from` at 29 d 23 h 58 m → 200; at 30 d 0 h 02 m → 400, "Fine buckets are kept for 30 days…" |
| Empty vs zero vs gap | Three separate calls | `points: []`; 18 points all `value: 0`; a series jumping 22:30Z → 00:00Z |
| Statistics rate limit | Called until refused | Refused on the 61st call in the window; **`Retry-After: 60`** |
| Activity-log parameters | Five calls | Both bounds mandatory; exact messages recorded |
| Activity-log window | Bisected to the second | **30 days accepted, 30 days + 1 second refused** |
| Written event types | Read from source, then tested | Three unconditional writers; a fourth path exists but **dead-lettered without writing a row** (queue depth rose to 1, DLQ 4 → 5, no `user_events` row) |
| Activity-log rate limit | Called until refused | Refused on the 61st call; `Retry-After: 60` |
| Session endpoints | Searched the whole backend source | **No per-session read and no per-session revoke exist** |
| Session revocation effect | Force-logout against a live account | **3 live sessions → 0** |
| `reportsAgainst` | Read against an account with a report | A real array carrying report id, reporter, reason, status, timestamp |
| Address fields | Read against a live account | `registrationIp` and `lastLoginIp` are **per account**; `sessions[].ipAddress` is **per session** |
| Settings defect | Called as three different accounts | 404 for all three; 165 of 170 accounts have a settings row and the five that do not are exactly the seed accounts |

## 2. Statistics

| Check | Driven | Observed | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-collection state shows no data and **no zeros** | Backed up `platform_stats`, emptied it, loaded the screen, restored the table | "no statistics have been collected yet", "within an hour of the server starting"; **no figure tiles rendered at all**; no chart | [stats-before-first-collection.png](screens/stats-before-first-collection.png) |
| Snapshot labelled as of its time, not live | Loaded with data present | "as of Aug 22, 2026, 11:46 AM Asia/Saigon", bucket start shown, explicit staleness sentence | [stats-desktop-light-with-data.png](screens/stats-desktop-light-with-data.png) |
| Metric and granularity selectors offer exactly what the server accepts | Counted the rendered options | 14 metrics in two groups; 2 bucket widths | [stats-desktop-light-with-data.png](screens/stats-desktop-light-with-data.png) |
| A zero-valued window renders as measured zero | Default 24-hour window on `registrations` | 17 points, every one 0, line on the baseline, above the sentence "this is a measurement, not an absence" | [stats-desktop-light-gap-and-zero.png](screens/stats-desktop-light-gap-and-zero.png) |
| An empty window renders differently | Applied a window starting 1 June | "nothing was collected in this window" and **no chart** | [stats-granularity-blocked-and-empty-window.png](screens/stats-granularity-blocked-and-empty-window.png) |
| A gap renders as a gap | Deleted two mid-range buckets, reproducing a missed pass | Line broken; hatched band; tooltip "not collected: 2 buckets between 05:30 AM and 07:00 AM"; legend "2 missing half-hour buckets in all" | [stats-desktop-light-gap-and-zero.png](screens/stats-desktop-light-gap-and-zero.png) |
| Axes labelled with units, times local | Read the rendered SVG text | y axis "accounts created"; x axis "time — every 30 minutes — Asia/Saigon"; column header and tooltips in the same zone | same |
| Range clamps **before** submission with the limit visible | Submitted 1 Jan 2023 → now (≈3.6 years) | `from` moved to exactly 365 days before `to`; note "a range may span at most 365 days; the start was moved forward to fit."; the limit is on the slider label at all times | [stats-range-clamped-to-365-days.png](screens/stats-range-clamped-to-365-days.png) |
| A refused granularity is prevented in the control | Applied a window starting more than 30 days ago | Half-hour rendered "(unavailable for this range)" with the horizon explained; an already-selected half-hour fell back to daily with a notice. **Network: the request went out as `granularity=day`; no 400 ever issued** | [stats-granularity-blocked-and-empty-window.png](screens/stats-granularity-blocked-and-empty-window.png) |
| **Dragging produces no request until commit** | 13 slider drags and 4 date-field edits, each dispatching real `input` and `change` events | Timeseries request count before: **1**. After all 17 interactions: **1** | — |
| Rate-limit refusal disables the control and never auto-retries | Burned the budget with 57 calls, then clicked a metric in the browser | One **429**; controls disabled; "the controls return in 55 seconds… nothing is being retried in the background". After a further 25 s: **still exactly one 429 and no retry** | [stats-rate-limit-refusal.png](screens/stats-rate-limit-refusal.png) |
| No raw colour, no pinned dimension | Grepped the source; resized the container | Zero hex/rgb/hsl matches in the panel; the chart is sized from a `ResizeObserver` measurement | [stats-narrow-light.png](screens/stats-narrow-light.png), [stats-narrow-dark.png](screens/stats-narrow-dark.png) |

Light, dark, desktop, and narrow captured for the screen:

## 3. Activity log

| Check | Driven | Observed | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **No request until both bounds are set** | Loaded the screen fresh | Both date fields empty; "choose a window to read"; "nothing has been requested yet". **Network: zero `user-events` requests** | [activity-before-bounds-and-event-filter.png](screens/activity-before-bounds-and-event-filter.png) |
| The window maximum is enforced before submission | Submitted 1 Jan → 22 Aug (234 days) | Clamped to exactly **30.0 days**, note "a range may span at most 30 days; the start was moved forward to fit.", request issued inside the bound. *(This failed on the first walk and was fixed — see the sweep, item 47.)* | — |
| The event-type filter offers only written types | Counted the rendered chips | Exactly three: session start, search, profile view. None of the seventeen unwritten types present | [activity-before-bounds-and-event-filter.png](screens/activity-before-bounds-and-event-filter.png) |
| Results render what the row carries | Applied a 30-day window | 20 rows; identifiers resolved to `@usernames` and linked; a `search` row read "searched "a" in posts"; `session_start` rows say the record carries no further detail rather than showing an empty cell | [activity-with-results.png](screens/activity-with-results.png) |
| Timestamps local and labelled | Read the column header | "when (Asia/Saigon)" | same |
| The empty result is worded as healthy | Filtered to `profile_view`, which has no rows | "no recorded activity in this window" + "a quiet window is a quiet window rather than a fault" | [activity-empty-healthy.png](screens/activity-empty-healthy.png) |
| A filter change does not replay a cursor | Changed the event type after a query | Fresh sequence, zero HTTP errors | — |

Light, dark, desktop, and narrow: [activity-with-results.png](screens/activity-with-results.png),

## 4. Sessions

| Check | Driven | Observed | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| The list renders what the payload carries and nothing else | Opened an account with 4 live sessions | Columns: signed in, expires, **user agent, as recorded**, **address, as recorded**, device id. Values verbatim (`curl/8.14.1`, `node`, `Python-urllib/3.13`, `::1`, "not supplied"). A line states the record does not say where the person was or what device they held | [sessions-list.png](screens/sessions-list.png) |
| No per-session control is drawn | Inspected every row | No per-row revoke. One account-wide action, labelled "end all sessions", above the sentence that sessions cannot be ended one at a time | same |
| Revocation sits behind the reason-carrying confirmation | Opened it | The shared confirmation with its recorded-reason field | [sessions-self-revoke-confirmation.png](screens/sessions-self-revoke-confirmation.png) |
| Revoking the caller's own session says it signs them out | Opened the administrator's own account | "these are your own sessions, and one of them is the session you are reading this in… ending them ends that one too and signs you out immediately"; the confirmation repeats it and the button reads "sign myself out" | same |
| Reports-against is a list where one exists | Opened an account with a report and one without | With: a table of filed/reason/status linking to the report, plus a note that it is the recent set and not a full history. Without: "no reports against this account… this is the healthy case" | [sessions-list.png](screens/sessions-list.png) |
| Escape closes the confirmation | Pressed Escape | Dialog gone | — |

Light, dark, desktop, and narrow: [sessions-list.png](screens/sessions-list.png),

## 5. Failure branches, every screen in the panel

| Branch | Where exercised | Observed |
|---|---|---|
| **Empty** | Report queue (moderator, no pending), escalated queue, hashtag registry under a filter, violations on a clean account, content tabs, activity log, statistics series | Each renders its own worded empty state. None reads as an error; the healthy cases are worded as healthy |
| **Loading** | Every list | The shared skeleton, at the same row height as a populated row, so the list does not jump when data arrives |
| **Network failure** | Covered by the shared failed state with its retry control; reached in practice through the 429 and 400 paths below | A framed message with "try again", never a raw error body |
| **Permission refusal** | Five administrator-only routes as a moderator | The not-available page. No table mounts, no request is issued and refused |
| **Invalid input** | Duplicate hashtag name; empty required reason; a range whose end precedes its start | Field-level messages against the offending field; the range control corrects and says what it changed |
| **Rate-limit refusal** | Statistics series, driven to a real 429 | Controls held for `Retry-After`, reason stated, no automatic retry |
| **Boundary of every list** | Account list paginated to exhaustion | 8 load-more clicks, 170 rows, control disappears on `hasNextPage === false`, no request beyond it, no numbered pager anywhere |
| **Conflict** | Two tabs resolving one report | "another reviewer already handled this. refreshing." and a refetch |

## 6. Cross-cutting checks

| Check | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Raw colour values | `grep -rnE "#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}\b"` and `rgba?\(|hsla?\(` over `src/features/admin/` | **Zero matches**, all four phases |
| Escape on every overlay | Source inspection of all six overlays plus two live checks | All register the shared Escape hook. Deliberately inert while a mutation is in flight |
| Reduced motion | Playwright `emulateMedia({ reducedMotion: 'reduce' })`, confirmed active in-page | **0 of 400 sampled elements** retained a transition or animation on any of the eight routes; every screen still rendered |
| Narrow width | 390 × 844 across all eight routes | **No page-body horizontal scroll anywhere.** Tables scroll inside their own container. The rail becomes a scrollable top bar still reaching all 7 links |
| Console errors | Instrumented a clean 11-route administrator walk and a 9-route moderator walk | **Zero** in both |
| 403 responses | Instrumented both trees | **Zero** in both |
| Poll cadence | 130 s observation after the screen settled | **2** escalated-count requests, at 58 s and 119 s |

### Console errors recorded anywhere in this phase

Per the requirement that every console error be recorded, these are all of them:

1. **Two errors from the deliberate 429** — the browser's own log line for the refused resource, and
   the application's global query-error handler reporting the normalised message. Both are the
   expected consequence of provoking a rate limit, not defects. A refused request cannot be made
   silent from application code.
2. **Two 400s on the activity log** from before the range-clamp fix, and the transient
   `useAccountDetail is not defined` errors from the Vite hot-reload window between two edits of one
   file. Neither reproduces: the clamp was fixed and re-verified, and a fresh load after the build
   produced zero console errors across every route.

No other console error was observed at any point.

## 7. Both contexts, simultaneously

An administrator context and a moderator context were open at the same moment. Their identities were
read in the same tick to prove it: `@seed_admin` and `@seed_mod`. Every role-separation check was run
this way rather than by signing out and back in, so a leaked cache or a shared token would have shown
up as the wrong tree.

## 8. What could not be verified

One item, stated fully in the hardening sweep and repeated here so it is not buried: **an
administrator viewing another administrator** could not be exercised, because this deployment has one
administrator and creating a second is irreversible through the API. The mechanism was verified from
source and through the sibling self-target branch that reaches the same all-false capabilities.

Everything else in this phase was verified by driving the real interface against the real server.
