# Orchestrator Brief

For the planner, who knows the product but has not seen this code and will not run the app.

## What was built

A reviewer can now answer "has this account done this before, and what did we do about it." The
panel gained:
- **Violation history** for an account — its warnings, and for an administrator its strikes —
  reached from a new account-moderation view and from the report detail (closing a previous-phase
  deferral). A moderator sees warnings only; an administrator sees warnings and strikes.
- **Warning issuance**: a vocabulary-driven reason selector plus a required note, issued from the
  account view and the report detail. Administrators may also revoke a warning or strike.
- **Per-account content**: an account's posts and comments as two tabs of one screen, with the
  remove/restore controls reused from the previous phase and removed content visibly distinguished.
- **The audit log**: one screen serving a moderator (its own actions) and an administrator (all),
  with a detail drawer that fetches an action's metadata on open and links back to the originating
  report.

All of it was browser-verified across two live sessions (moderator + administrator) with 30
screenshots. The user-facing app and the previous phase's report queue/detail still work.

## Architectural decisions, and the option rejected

- **Warn eligibility renders for both roles (option b).** Evidence: a moderator may warn an
  ordinary account (200), and an ineligible target is refused with a specific code
  (`ADMIN_TARGET_NOT_WARNABLE`) the panel surfaces honestly. Rejected: option (a),
  administrator-only, which would strip a capability the moderator actually has.
- **Rendering the violation union branches on the discriminator `kind`**, never on a field's
  presence. The union's shape is not in the OpenAPI (typed `any`); it was enumerated by producing
  records.
- **A new minimal account host** (`/admin/users/:userId`) carries only this phase's surfaces — no
  ban/suspend/role/force-logout/profile. Rejected: putting these on nothing, or waiting for the
  account screen; the surfaces need a shareable home now and the account phase will expand it.
- **The drawer renders metadata by recognising keys, with a generic fallback**, rather than
  switching on action type — so an unenumerated shape renders legibly. The open action lives in a
  URL query param so the list stays mounted and the link is shareable.
- **The reason selector is an in-DOM listbox**, not a native `<select>`, so a disabled vocabulary
  entry is visible and unselectable rather than hidden in an OS popup.

## Contract divergences found (full list in `discipline-contract-verification.md`)

- **The warn endpoint path in the prompt does not exist.** It is
  `POST /admin/warnings/for-user/{userId}`, not `POST /admin/users/{userId}/warn`.
- **A moderator MAY issue a warning** — warn is not administrator-only.
- **A revoked record is removed from the violations list**, not marked revoked. This contradicts
  requirement 5.1.6 (see below).
- **The content row carries no media field** — requirement 7.1.5's media array does not exist.
- **The audit log declares only `actionType` and `adminId` filters** — no date range, no target
  filter.
- The violation union discriminator is `kind ∈ {warning, strike}`; cursors are role-scoped
  (cross-role replay → `INVALID_CURSOR`); a moderator gets 404 on a foreign action's detail; every
  observed action type is in the vocabulary; strikes auto-issue every third warning.

## Controls deferred, and why

- **Ban, unban, suspend, unsuspend, role change, force logout** — out of scope; belong to the
  account phase, which will add them to the account host built here.
- **The `adminId` audit filter** renders no control this phase — selecting an actor needs a user
  picker that the account phase's search provides. Recorded, not faked.
- **Strike issuance has no direct control** — strikes are auto-issued by the backend on the third
  warning; there is no issue-strike endpoint.

## Open questions for a human before the next phase

1. **The revoked-record divergence (requirement 5.1.6 / DoD 9).** The backend removes a revoked
   record from the violations list; the panel cannot show a revoked-but-visible record without
   fabricating data. The revocation is preserved in the action log instead.
   Options: **(a, recommended)** accept the server behaviour — the record leaves the discipline
   list and remains auditable in the action log; **(b)** request a backend change to return revoked
   records with a `revokedAt`/`revokedBy` so the discipline list can mark them in place. Recommend
   (a) while the backend is frozen; raise (b) as a backend ticket if in-place marking is required.
2. **The account host's scope.** `/admin/users/:userId` is intentionally minimal. Confirm the
   account phase should expand this same route with the lifecycle controls rather than build a
   separate account-detail screen.

## What could not be verified

- **A revoked record shown as still-present and marked revoked** — impossible without fabricating
  data the backend never returns (divergence above), so the honest outcome (the record leaves; the
  revocation lives in the action log) was verified instead.
- **The `{resultingStatus, strippedHashtags}` and an unknown metadata shape** were exercised by
  response interception, because the reset seed has no banned-hashtag post and the backend never
  emits an unknown shape. The interception tested the exact drawer renderer.

Nothing above is a check the available tooling could in fact have run. Reduced motion — the
previous phase's could-not-verify item — was fully verified this phase and removed from that
phase's brief.
