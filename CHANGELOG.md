# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Hashtag detail page at `/app/tags/:name`, with a shareable `/tags/:name` deep link that redirects to it.
- Trending hashtags in the right rail, with a personalised tab and a platform tab and a marker on pinned hashtags.
- Hashtag suggestions in the composer before any text is typed, replaced by live search results as soon as a `#` token is being written.
- Hashtag tokens inside post captions are now links to that hashtag's page.

### Changed
- A hashtag result in search and explore now opens that hashtag's page instead of running a caption text search for its name, which returned unrelated posts or nothing at all.
- The preview server proxies the API, so a production build can be exercised against a local backend.

### Fixed
- The tablet shell no longer overflows the viewport at 768 pixels wide, where the reading column previously started off-screen and the right rail extended past the right edge.
- The tablet right spacer now matches the left one, so the reading column is centred rather than sitting left of centre.
- Layout decisions that depend on the viewport width now update when the window is resized within one breakpoint.
