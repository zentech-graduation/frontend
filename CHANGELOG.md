# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Removed "Already have a reset token?" link from `ForgotPasswordPage` and "This email may already be waiting for verification" link from `RegisterPage` to streamline the user flow.

### Fixed
- Added `AbortController` cleanup to the async `verifyEmail` effect in `EmailVerificationPage`; `navigate` and `setTokenError` are now no-ops if the component unmounts before the request resolves.
- Added `AbortController` cleanup to the async `clearSession` effect in `HomePage`; `logout()` is guarded against post-unmount invocation.
- Replaced `href="#"` anchor elements in `AuthBrandPanel` footer with `<button type="button">` elements; eliminates the false navigation affordance, spurious history entries, and scroll-to-top side effect.
- Documented the intentional `window.location.assign` usage in `axiosClient.js` as an audited exception; the Axios interceptor runs outside the React tree and cannot use `useNavigate`.

### Removed
- Deleted unused `AuthLayout.jsx` and `MainLayout.jsx` scaffold files; neither was imported anywhere in the application.

### Added
- Added `GlobalErrorBoundary` class component wrapping the entire app in `main.jsx`; render-phase crashes now show a recoverable fallback instead of a blank screen.
- Added `RouterErrorPage` component as `errorElement` on the root route; route-level loader/action errors are caught and display user-safe copy with Go back / Home recovery actions.
- Added global `QueryCache` and `MutationCache` `onError` handlers to `QueryClient`; all TanStack Query failures flow through a single logging point (401s excluded — owned by the Axios interceptor).
- Added `normalizeAxiosError` to `axiosClient.js`; all Axios errors on both `publicClient` and `axiosClient` are normalized before reaching any consumer — raw database constraints, Hibernate/Spring class names, SQL fragments, internal status enum values (INACTIVE, BANNED), and stack trace strings are redacted and replaced with safe user-facing copy.

### Fixed
- Scrubbed `?token=` from the URL in `EmailVerificationPage` via `history.replaceState` before the async verification call, preventing the token from persisting in browser history.
- Scrubbed `?token=` from the URL in `ResetPasswordPage` via `useLayoutEffect`+`history.replaceState` synchronously before first paint; the token is retained in RHF `defaultValues` (in-memory only).
- `ProtectedRoute` now passes only `{ pathname }` in `location.state.from` — `search` and `hash` are stripped, closing the leak where `?token=` query params could survive in navigation state across history traversal.
- `ProtectedRoute` now requires both `isAuthenticated` (persisted) and a live `accessToken` (in-memory) before granting access, closing the race between persist rehydration and `AuthSessionBootstrap` token refresh on cold page loads.

### Fixed
- Consolidated duplicate `LoginPage` implementations; `src/features/auth/components/LoginPage.jsx` is now the single canonical entry point wired into the router.
- Merged conflicting Zod schema files into `src/features/auth/utils/authSchemas.js`; the `src/components/auth/authSchemas.js` copy has been deleted.
- Retargeted all schema consumers (`ForgotPasswordPage`, `RegisterPage`, `ResetPasswordPage`) to import from the canonical feature-slice location.

### Removed
- Deleted `src/pages/auth/LoginPage.jsx` (superseded by feature-slice canonical).
- Deleted `src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.jsx` (shadcn scaffold stub, replaced by the full LoginPage).
- Deleted `src/components/auth/authSchemas.js` (merged into feature-slice utils).

### Fixed
- Removed literal `nom` syntax token from `cn.js` that caused a parse error breaking all shadcn/ui primitives.
- Wrapped auth store in Zustand `persist` middleware; `accessToken` and `refreshToken` are now in-memory only and excluded from `localStorage` via `partialize`.
- Fixed `hasHydrated` initialization — it now starts `false` and is set `true` exclusively via `onRehydrateStorage`, eliminating the race where consumers read a stale hydration flag.
- Removed implicit OAuth flow (response_type `token id_token`) from the Google OAuth URL builder; only the authorization-code flow (`code`) is now issued.
- Removed client-side JWT parsing via `window.atob` (`decodeJwt`, `buildUserFromGoogleClaims`) — user identity is now established exclusively by the backend.
- Enforced strict CSRF state check in `OAuthCallbackPage`: both stored and returned `state` values must be present and equal; missing either side is now a hard failure.
- URL hash and query tokens are scrubbed via `history.replaceState` before any async exchange begins in `OAuthCallbackPage`.
- Added `useRef` guard to `OAuthCallbackPage` to prevent double-invocation under React Strict Mode.

### Added
- Added GitHub governance files including issue templates, pull request template, CODEOWNERS, and CI-related workflows.

### Changed
- Updated repository ignore rules to keep local `.env` files out of version control.
- Added agent instructions, local agent rules, and a project structure reference for future coding sessions.
