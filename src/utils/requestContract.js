 * The backend rejects any undeclared query parameter on `/api/v1/admin/**` with

 * whole state to a request body, both fail here.
 *
 * These live at the shared layer rather than inside the panel because the help
 * centre obeys the same contract, and a feature must not import from another.
 *
 * These helpers are the single mechanism the panel uses to obey that contract:
 * a query serialiser that keeps only an endpoint's declared parameter keys, and
 * a body builder that is written out field by field at every call site.

/**
 * Reduces a filter object to only the keys an endpoint declares, dropping any

 *
 * Every list call passes its own declared-key list so a stray filter key can
 * never reach the wire, which is enforced even on the report endpoints that do
 * not police it, so the same defensive habit holds everywhere.
 *
 * @param {Object} filters the caller's filter state, possibly with extra keys
 * @param {string[]} declaredKeys the exact parameter names the endpoint accepts
 * @returns {Object} a params object containing only declared, meaningful values
