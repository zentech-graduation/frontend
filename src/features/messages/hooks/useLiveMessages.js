/**
 * Applies live message frames for the open conversation.
 *
 * Additive by design: if the socket never connects, the screen behaves exactly as it did before and
 * the REST responses remain authoritative. A dropped frame costs freshness until the next refetch,
 * never correctness.
 *
 * The frame is used as a signal rather than as data. Its payload differs per event type, so
 * invalidating and re-reading keeps this hook independent of that shape, at the cost of one request
 * per event. Conversations arrive one message at a time, so that cost is bounded by how fast a
 * person types.
