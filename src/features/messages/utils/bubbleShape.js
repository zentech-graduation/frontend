/**
 * Per-corner border radius for a message bubble (or album tile) that is part of a run of
 * consecutive same-sender messages.
 *
 * The side facing the conversation - away from the screen edge - always stays fully rounded: the
 * left side for the viewer's own (right-aligned) messages, the right side for the other
 * person's (left-aligned) ones. The outer side, nearest the screen edge, is what varies: rounded
 * at the run's own start and end (the "tail" that marks where a burst of messages begins and
 * ends), flattened everywhere it touches a neighboring bubble in between - the same run a
 * consecutive burst already collapses its avatar and separator for.
