/**
 * The live sessions of an account, and the reports filed against it.
 *
 * Both arrive inside the account detail payload rather than from an endpoint of
 * their own, so both are bounded sets with no cursor behind them. That is stated
 * rather than implied, because a list that looks paginated and is not invites a
 * reviewer to believe they have seen everything.
 *
 * **A session record is rendered as exactly what it carries.** The payload holds
 * a refresh-token row id, an optional opaque device id, the user agent string
 * recorded when the session was issued, the client address recorded at the same
 * moment, and two timestamps. It does not hold a location, a city, a resolved
 * device name, or a marker for which session is the reader's own. An address
 * shown as a place, or a user agent shown as "iPhone 15", would be the interface
 * inventing a fact from a string — and an address in particular is the kind of
 * invented fact a reviewer would then act on.
 *
 * **A session is ended one at a time, or all at once.** Both exist and they do
 * different jobs, so both are offered and each is named for what it does:
 * revoking one row ends that session and leaves the rest signed in, while the
 * account-wide action ends every session the account holds.
 *
 * **The reader's own row is marked by correlation, not by invention.** The
 * payload carries no "this is you" field. `POST /api/v1/auth/session` names the
 * caller's session and that id is matched against `row.id`. When the server
 * cannot determine it — which it reports as a null id, not an error — no row is
 * marked and the list says the determination was not possible, because an
 * unmarked list would otherwise read as "none of these is yours".
 *
 * **A revoked session cannot be un-revoked.** Nothing here implies otherwise:
 * the row leaves the list on the next read and the person signs in again, which
 * is the whole recovery path.
