/**
 * Derived pattern: a single status indicator that serves every status
 * enumeration in the panel (report, account, hashtag, post). The design export
 * defines no such component, so this is derived work built from the four
 * semantic colour tokens plus a neutral tone from the surface and ink scale.
 *
 * One visual vocabulary serves all four domains by encoding lifecycle position
 * rather than domain. The mapping and its reasoning are recorded in
 * design-decisions.md. Any status not in the map falls back to the neutral tone
 * rather than throwing, so a value added to a backend enum still renders.
 */
/**
 * The label sits on --lx-ink rather than on the tone's own text token. Measured
 * in the light theme, every semantic text token on its matching dim fill falls
 * short of 4.5:1 — warning reads 2.85 and success 3.75 — because both the fill
 * and the text are pale. Darkening the text further would have meant inventing
 * a token, so the hue moved instead: the tone is carried by the fill and a
 * matching border, and the word itself is ink, which clears 4.5:1 on every dim
 * fill in both themes. The status stays colour-coded; it is now also readable.
