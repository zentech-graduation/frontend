/**
 * An account's discipline record with the control to warn it: the violation
 * history plus the warn button and its dialog, as one drop-in panel used by both
 * the account moderation screen and the report detail. Sharing it means the
 * report detail closes the two items the previous phase deferred — the owner's
 * violation history and the warn-the-owner control — with the same code the
 * account screen uses, rather than a second copy.
 *
 * **The warn control renders only where the target can actually be warned.**
 * Only an ordinary account may be warned; the backend refuses an elevated target
 * with `ADMIN_TARGET_NOT_WARNABLE`. Where the target's role is knowable the
 * control is withheld rather than offered and then refused, because a control
 * that always fails is worse than no control.
 *
 * Whether the role is knowable depends on the caller. An administrator can read
 * it from the account detail, so for an administrator this is decided before
 * anything renders. A moderator cannot read that endpoint at all, so for a
 * moderator the control is offered and an ineligible target is surfaced through
 * the specific refusal code — the fallback the backend handoff prescribes for
 * exactly this asymmetry, and defensible because the accounts a moderator
 * reaches from a report are almost always ordinary ones.
 *
 * On success the history refetches through the mutation's cache invalidation, so
 * a new warning appears without a reload.
 *
 * @param {string} userId the account this panel acts on
