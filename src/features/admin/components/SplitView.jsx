/**
 * Derived pattern: the panel's master and detail layout. The design export
 * covers no working surface of this kind, so the two regions are built from the
 * existing surface, border and spacing tokens.
 *
 * The list holds the left region and the selected record fills the right. Both
 * regions scroll on their own, so a long detail never scrolls the list away.
 * Because the list is one component instance that stays mounted while the
 * selection changes, selecting another record swaps only the right region: the
 * list keeps its scroll offset and every page it has already loaded, and it
 * issues no further request.
 *
 * At a narrow width the split is not a split. The stylesheet hides whichever
 * region is not in play, so the list is the whole screen until a record is
 * opened and the detail is the whole screen afterwards, with a way back. That
 * is a layout change rather than a horizontally scrolling pair of panes.
