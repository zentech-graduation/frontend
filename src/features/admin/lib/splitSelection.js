/**
 * Which record a split screen has open.
 *
 * The selection lives in the address bar under `selected`, so a detail open in
 * the right region has its own URL, that URL restores the same state in a fresh
 * tab, and the browser's back button walks back through the records that were
 * opened before returning to the bare list.
 *
 * `selected` was chosen over a nested route segment because the two split
 * screens cannot both be expressed as a route parent: the account list is
 * administrator-only while the account detail is reachable by a moderator from
 * the action log, so nesting the detail under the list would take a screen away
 * from moderators. A search parameter carries the same addressability without
 * moving either screen inside the other's guard, and every path that worked
 * before still works untouched.
 *
 * A selection that names a record the list does not (or no longer) contains is
 * treated as no selection, so a stale link opens the list rather than an empty
 * detail. Nothing is selected by default: the right region explains itself
 * until a record is picked.
