/**
 * The panel's only mechanism for turning an account id into a name.
 *
 * Every screen in the panel renders ids that mean nothing to a reviewer: the
 * reporter on a queue row, the actor and the target on an audit row, whoever
 * revoked a warning. Resolving each one with its own request cost a page of
 * twenty rows as many requests as it held distinct people, against an endpoint
 * whose production budget is the tightest in the system.
 *
 * `GET /api/v1/admin/user-summaries?ids=` resolves up to a hundred in one call,
 * so this module coalesces every id a rendered page asks for into a single
 * request. Callers still ask one id at a time — that is what a row can know —
 * and this batches underneath them.
 *
 * Three properties of the endpoint shape the implementation, all measured in
 * `uptake-contract-verification.md` §1.5:
 *
 * 1. `ids[]=a` — which is what Axios serialises an array to by default — is
 *    rejected with 400. The request must send repeated bare `ids=` keys, which
 *    `adminApi.getUserSummaries` pins down.
 * 2. More than 100 ids is a 400, not a truncated list, so a larger set is split.
 * 3. An unknown id comes back present with `found: false` rather than being
 *    omitted. That is a resolved fact, not a failure: it settles as a null name
 *    so the caller renders a shortened id and React Query caches it, which is
 *    what stops an unresolvable id from being retried on every render.
 *
 * The response preserves request order, and this module still never relies on
 * it: entries are indexed by their own `userId` and looked up by id. Order is
 * the endpoint's guarantee to make, not this module's to depend on.
