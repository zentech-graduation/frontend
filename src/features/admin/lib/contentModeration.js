 * post twice returns the same names both times
 * (`uptake-contract-verification.md` §3).
 *
 * That is why this reads "still carries" rather than "dropped". A reviewer who
 * restores a post twice sees the same names twice, and the sentence has to make
 * that read as a description of the post rather than as the action repeating or
 * as a bug. "dropped: #x" said twice describes two events that did not happen.

 * `created_at`. Computing "expired" from `createdAt` would state the opposite of
