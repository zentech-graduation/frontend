/**
 * The statistics contract, expressed as data and pure functions.

 *
 * The three rules this module exists to enforce:
 *
 * 1. An empty series and a series of measured zeros are different facts and are
 *    never conflated. `[]` means nothing was ever collected; a point with value
 *    0 means the job ran, looked, and counted nothing.
 * 2. A bucket absent from a returned series is a gap, not a zero. The series is
 *    cut into segments at every gap so no line is ever drawn across one.
 * 3. Every limit the server enforces is enforced here first, so a reviewer meets
 *    a bounded control rather than a 400.

 * flows and takes the last value for gauges, and summing 48 snapshots of "total
 * accounts" would produce a number 48 times too large. The panel therefore never
 * aggregates a series itself — it draws the points it was given — and the kind is
