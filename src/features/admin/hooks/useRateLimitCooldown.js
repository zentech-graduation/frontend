/**
 * The rate-limit cooldown that `useDebouncedSearch` applies to a search box,
 * lifted out for controls that are not search boxes.
 *
 * The two tightest budgets in the system are the statistics timeseries and the
 * activity log, at 20 requests a minute in production. Both are driven by a
 * control a reviewer can operate quickly, so both need the same discipline: on a
 * 429, read `Retry-After`, refuse to submit for exactly that long, say why, and
 * never retry on a timer. An automatic retry against a rate limit turns a burst
 * into a longer burst and takes the decision away from the person who can see
 * what is happening.
 *
 * A half-second tick drives the countdown, so the remaining time is visible
 * rather than the control simply being inert.
