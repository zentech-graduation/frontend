/**
 * The reports this caller escalated, as an infinite cursor list.
 *
 * This exists because escalating a report is the one moderation act whose
 * outcome a moderator otherwise loses sight of. A moderator's report queue
 * shows `pending` and `reviewing` only, and a closed report answers 404 to a
 * moderator — with the single exception of one it escalated itself, which is
 * what makes this list possible at all.
 *
 * **It carries no status filter, and that is the point.** A report an
 * administrator has since resolved or dismissed still appears here, because the
 * outcome is the thing the escalation was for. Adding a status filter would
 * hide exactly the rows the screen exists to show, so none is offered and none
 * is applied client-side.
 *
 * The role is in the query key like every other list, though this endpoint
 * scopes by caller rather than by role: an administrator calling it receives its
 * own escalations, not everyone's.
