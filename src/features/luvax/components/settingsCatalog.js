/**
 * The settings groups and the categories inside them.
 *
 * Every category here corresponds to at least one endpoint that was called and
 * recorded in
 * `docs/user-settings-and-auth-errors/settings-contract-verification.md`.
 * Nothing is listed because a comparable product has it. If the inventory in
 * that document does not contain a row for a control, the control is not built.
 *
 * The group names are the person's own words rather than system nouns, and the
 * two named in the brief set the tone for the third:
 *
 *   how you use luvax     - the account's own presence and what it receives
 *   who can see your content - visibility and audience
 *   your account          - what is true about the account, and how you get in
 *
 * The third group exists because the inventory holds real settings that fit
 * neither of the first two: the email address, the verified badge, the join
 * date, the warnings the account has received, the password reset, and signing
 * out. These are facts about the account and its access, not preferences about
 * presence or audience. The reasoning is recorded in `design-decisions.md`.
