/**
 * A two-state switch.
 *
 * It reports itself as a switch rather than as a plain button, so its on/off
 * state is announced and it is operable from the keyboard like every other
 * control on the page. `label` gives it an accessible name; without one a
 * switch reads as an unlabelled control, since the text describing it sits in a
 * sibling element rather than inside the button.
 *
 * The knob transition uses the shared duration and easing, so the global
 * prefers-reduced-motion rule neutralises it along with the rest of the
 * application.
