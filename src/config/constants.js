  // Support is a settings category rather than a screen of its own. Every
  // surface it needs was built and none of them had an entry point: nothing in
  // the signed-in navigation reached /app/support, so the only support-shaped
  // thing a user could find was a verification form buried in account settings.
  SETTINGS_SUPPORT: '/app/settings/support',
  // Kept because it was a published address before the settings rebuild. It now
  // resolves to the account category, which carries the only password action
  // the backend actually offers, rather than to a screen that said it was not
  // built yet.
  CHANGE_PASSWORD: '/app/settings/password',
  BLOCKED_USERS: '/app/settings/blocked',

  SAVED: '/app/settings/saved',

  // SETTINGS_SUPPORT, so a bookmark or an older link still lands on support
  // while there is exactly one place that looks like the entrance.
  SUPPORT: '/app/support',
  // A ticket keeps its own address. The detail could have been folded into the

  SUPPORT_TICKET: '/app/support/:ticketId',

  // escalations rather than everyone's. Its own segment for the same
  // no-collision reason as the escalated queue.
  ADMIN_MY_ESCALATIONS: '/admin/my-escalations',
  // The moderation action log. A moderator sees its own actions here; an
  // administrator sees all. The open action's detail lives in the `action`
  // query parameter so a specific action is a shareable link.
  ADMIN_ACTIONS: '/admin/actions',
  // The account list and search. Administrator only: the backend answers the
  // whole account surface (list, search, detail) with 403 for a moderator. A row
  // opens the account at ADMIN_USER.
  ADMIN_USERS: '/admin/users',
  // An account's moderation context: its violation history, its posts and
  // comments, the warn control, and — for an administrator — the lifecycle
  // controls (ban, suspend, role change, force logout) driven by the account's
  // capabilities. Reachable by both roles; a moderator sees only the discipline
  // surfaces because the capabilities-bearing detail is administrator-only.
  // Build with `routeTo.adminUser`.
  ADMIN_USER: '/admin/users/:userId',

  ADMIN_HASHTAGS: '/admin/hashtags',
  // Moderator-reachable, not administrator-only: verification is a discretionary grant rather than
  // an enforcement action, so it sits with reports rather than with the account list.
  // The staff support console. Verification review happens here, as one
  // category of ticket among the rest, rather than on a screen of its own: a
  // verification request is a support ticket, claimed and decided by the same

  ADMIN_SUPPORT: '/admin/support',
  // Platform statistics. Administrator only; both statistics endpoints answer a

  // fire on arrival.
