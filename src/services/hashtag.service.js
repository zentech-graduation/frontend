 * Hashtag reads: name resolution, the posts carrying a hashtag, and the two trending surfaces.

 * helpers each call site already uses, even though `global_rules.md` section 3 says services should

 * `HASHTAG_NOT_FOUND` means no hashtag carries the name, `HASHTAG_UNAVAILABLE` means one does but
 * an administrator has taken it out of circulation. Neither is the same as a hashtag that exists
 * and simply has no posts yet, which answers 200 with an empty page.
