/**
 * Tracks a rate-limit cooldown window derived from a 429's `Retry-After`.
 *
 * On a 429, a caller reads `Retry-After`, calls `start(seconds)`, and gates
 * further requests on `cooling` until the window elapses. Never retries on a
 * fixed timer of its own: the caller decides when to try again, this hook
 * only reports whether it is too soon.
 *
 * Duplicated from `src/features/admin/hooks/useRateLimitCooldown.js`
 * (identical behavior) rather than imported across features, because the
 * project forbids cross-feature imports and shared logic must be extracted
 * to a shared layer before being consumed from more than one feature. This
 * lives in `src/hooks/` as that shared layer for the luvax and search
 * features; admin's copy is left untouched.
