/**
 * Every screen reachable inside the authenticated shell.
 *
 * The router builds its child routes from this list and the app layout reads the
 * same list back to work out which screen sits behind an overlay, so the two can
 * never disagree about which address renders which screen.
 *
 * `screen` is the identifier the shell already keys its chrome off: which tab
 * reads as active, whether a back header replaces the logo, and how wide the
 * tablet pane is. Keeping the existing identifiers is what makes this refactor
 * invisible.
 *
 * `chrome` selects the frame:
 * - `shell`    the standard app bar, rails, and bottom nav
 * - `messages` the fixed full-height pane messages has always rendered in
 * - `bare`     no frame at all
 *
 * `rightRail` reproduces the existing rule that only the feed and explore show
 * the trending rail.
